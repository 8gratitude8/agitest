The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React is a shared dependency across all the files.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used for type checking and improved developer experience. It is used in all the `.tsx` files.

4. **React DOM**: This is used in all the `.tsx` files for rendering the components.

5. **CSS Modules**: CSS Modules are used for styling the components. They are used in the `.css` files and the `.tsx` files that import them.

6. **Public assets**: The `favicon.ico` and `vercel.svg` files in the `public` directory are shared dependencies as they can be used across the application.

7. **_app.tsx and _document.tsx**: These are special Next.js files that wrap around all pages. They share dependencies with all other pages in the application.

8. **Header.tsx and Footer.tsx**: These components are likely used across multiple pages, making them shared dependencies.

9. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of all the dependencies and scripts for the application. It is a shared dependency as it affects the entire application.

10. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for TypeScript. It is a shared dependency as it affects all the TypeScript files in the application.

11. **.next/config.js**: This file contains the configuration for Next.js. It is a shared dependency as it affects the entire Next.js application.
